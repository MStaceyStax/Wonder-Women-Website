💭 Project - Just a Wonder Woman Website. While learning new concepts and progressing in my learning journey, I decided to come up with a Wonder Woman Website beacuse I love Wonder Woman and she is me and I am her. 

🎨 Features - The key features of this websites was implementing styling into this website. I saw how experienting with CSS and being bold about brings across a strong website as well. I have included spacing and buttons with hovering and formalising it with borders and solid backgrounds. 

📦 Tech Stack - HTML & CSS

🎯 The Process - My intention for this website was to come across strong and bold of which displays and describes the character to the tee. I steps out of my safe place of having a white backfround and experiented with bold colours and making use of an image as a background as well. The process was hard as I played with new code and commands to try and achieve the look that I had in my mind. As we as researching the different effects and code that I wanted to implement on W3, watching youtube tutorials and receiving advise from Mentors. 

✏️Lessons Learnt - Do not be afraid to ask for help. Do do be afriad to ask for help with your code. We are all winners in the end

📈 Areas of Improvement - Being bolder and getting out of my comfort zone. I think by does this, I can accomplish much more. 

🧠 Overall Growth – less is not always more. Discovering what type of developer I am as well is interesting.
